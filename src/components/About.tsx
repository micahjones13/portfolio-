      <p className="text-gray-300">
        I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for frontend work. With 5 years of development experience,
        I've spent the last 4 years specializing in Design Systems, React, TypeScript, and Web Components. My expertise
        in component architecture and modern web technologies is complemented by my adaptability and enthusiasm for
        learning. I thrive in dynamic environments and have a proven track record of quickly mastering new technologies
        to deliver exceptional solutions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300">My main hobbies are playing with my daughter, exasperating my wife and playing video games. I love growing things 
        and have recently gotten really into gardening, but still can't get a bell pepper to grow. I hate sprinklers. I currently live in American Fork, Utah.
